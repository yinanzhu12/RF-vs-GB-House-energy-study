# RF-vs-GB-House-energy-study
Hi welcome

If you only have 30 seconds to read this project, here it goes

1. Some theory and algorithm in "A layman's introduction to random forest and gradient boost.pdf". Maybe too easy for you

2. Lots of code and picture in "House energy study.ipynb"

3. For gradient boost, you should restrict each trees toughly and wait for the model to improve after 5000+ steps. For random forest, feel free to make each tree overfit, because those overfit will be "averaged out".

4. On the this particular data set, gradient boosting beats random forest by a little margin (in terms of R^2 0.57 vs. 0.56), but a combinational model (by averaging both mode) beats both.

That being said, I still hope you can spend more time here and enjoy!
